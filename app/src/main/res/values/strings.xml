        <h2>SimpleTemp</h2>
        This application may help us track the coronavirus.  In the absence of sufficient testing,
        we hope that by crowd-sourcing temperatures, we can identify outbreaks of the virus
        so that the affected communities can get the help they need.<br /><br />
        You may use the app on a single phone to track the temperatures of a few people.
        When you report a temperature for one of the people you are monitoring, the temperature
        and a few other details are sent to a central server, for analysis.  As more people do it
        you will be able to see the temperatures of people around you.<br /><br />
        Note that nothing in the report sent to the server, can identify you:
        <ul>
        <li>The report includes a unique identifier.  That identifier is encrypted on your phone and can only be decrypted with your password.</li>
        <li>The report include location information.  That information is rounded to the nearest mile.</li>
        <li>The app has no facility for connecting with other installments on other phones.  It cannot report interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        Join the SimpleTemp movement and stay safe!
